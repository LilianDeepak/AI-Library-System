AI-Powered E-Library System using React JS is a smart digital library designed to enhance book accessibility, management, and user experience through AI. It features three main modules:

Admin: Manages books, users, borrowing, and generates reports.

User: Allows registration, browsing, borrowing, wishlisting, and notifications.

AI Recommendation System: Provides personalized book suggestions based on user behavior using collaborative filtering.

This system uses cloud storage and machine learning to automate traditional library tasks, improve search efficiency, and deliver customized recommendations â€” making it ideal for educational institutions and avid readers.
